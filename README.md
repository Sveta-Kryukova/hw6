## Task 1: Quasi-Tagged Templates
In this task, we implemented a function called localize that utilizes quasi-tagged templates for handling multiple languages. The function takes a template string and an object containing language-specific translations. It replaces placeholders in the template string with the corresponding translations from the provided object.

## Task 2: Advanced Tagged Template
Here, we created a function called highlightKeywords that acts as a tagged template. It takes a template string and an array of keywords. The function highlights each occurrence of a keyword in the template by wrapping it in a <span> element with a specific CSS class. Template literals and string manipulation were used to achieve this.

## Task 3: Multiline Tagged Template
For this task, we implemented the multiline tagged template function. It takes a template string and returns a string with line numbers added at the beginning of each line. Line numbers start from 1 and increase for each line. The original indentation of each line is preserved.

## Task 4: Implementing Debounce Function
In this task, we implemented the debounce function, which ensures that a provided function is only executed after the user stops invoking it for a specified delay time. 

## Task 5: Implementing Throttle Function
For this task, we implemented the throttle function, which ensures that a provided function is executed at most once within a specified time interval. Example usage:

## Task 6: Currying Function Implementation
Lastly, we implemented a currying function using the curry function. This technique transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. 

These tasks cover a range of JavaScript concepts, from tagged templates for localization to debounce, throttle, and currying functions for optimizing code behavior and improving user experience.
